      <t>
        The Hyper-Text Transport Protocol (HTTP) offers several
        authentication schemes, but many sites use redirection-based
        protocols to authenticate users.  Some servers are faced with a
        connundrum, having to choose between two mutually-exclusive
        options: redirect responses or 401 (authentication required)
        responses without knowing which the user-agent is most likely to
        support.
      </t>

      <t>
        This document specifies new HTTP request headers by which many
        applications can improve interoperability even without changing
        their HTTP implementations.  These new headers allow user-agents
        to advertise authentication- and redirect-related capbilities
        that servers can use to better make authentication and/or
        redirect decisions.
      </t>
      <t>
        Also specified is a new HTTP authentication scheme named
        "Redirect" that enables communication between redirecting and
        redirected authorities via preservation of "Authorization" and
        "Authorization-Request" headers across redirections.  This
        enables arbitrary authentication and authorization protocols to
        work without requiring user-agent support for them.
      </t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">

      <t>
        The Hyper-Text Transport Protocol (HTTP) <xref
          target="RFC7230">RFC7230</xref> provides several schemes for user
        authentication.  There also are popular ways of authenticating users
        based on redirection rather than standard HTTP authentication schemes.
        Heretofore, HTTP has provided no standard way for servers to know
        which authentication schemes, including redirect-based methods, a
        given user-agent supports, but servers must choose between either
        redirection or HTTP authentication, and these two are mutually
        exclusive.
      </t>

      <t>
        This situation arises especially in corporate networks where
        JSON Web Tokens (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519"/> and Negotiate <xref
          target="RFC4559"/> are both used, the latter usually with the
        Kerberos <xref target="RFC4120"/> GSS-API <xref target="RFC2743"/>
        mechanism <xref target="RFC4121"/>.
      </t>

      <t>
        We address this problem by adding new request headers,
        "Accept-Auth:", "Accept-Redirect-Auth:", and "Accept-Redirect:"
        by which a user-agent can indicate which HTTP authentication
        schemes, if any, it supports, including redirection.
      </t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>
          The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
          "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
          document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
            target="RFC2119">RFC 2119</xref>.

      </section>
    </section>

    <section anchor="accept_redirect" title="Accept-Redirect and
      Accept-Redirect-Auth">
      <t>
        The Accept-Redirect request header has two possible values:
        "yes" and "no".  If "yes", this means the user-agent will follow
        redirections, and the user-agent may or may not be willing to
        authenticate at the redirected origin depending on local policy.
      </t>

      <t>
        The Accept-Redirect-Auth request header exists to indicate which
        authorities the user-agent is willing to redirect to and
        authenticate at.  Its value is a whitespace-separate list of
        domainnames.  If empty or has just the value ".", then the
        service can conclude only that the user-agent has a whitelist,
        but is not disclosing it.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="accept_auth" title="Accept-Auth">
      <t>
        The Accept-Auth request header may have multiple values, or be present
        multiple times, as with most HTTP headers.  Each value names one
        authentication schemes, and optionally may indicate schemes-specific
        metadata.
      </t>

      <t>
        Accept-Auth values are similar to WWW-Authenticate values <xref
          target="RFC7235"/>, but they do not have quite the same form, and they
        are not challenges.  Using ABNF <xref target="RFC5234"/>:"

    <section anchor="redirect" title="The Redirect Authentication Scheme">
      <t>
        Many sites use redirect-based protocols for authentication.
        such protocols exchange cryptographic messages between
        a relying party origin and an authenticator origin.  Some such
        protocols use URI query parameters to carry cryptographic
        messages.  Others depend on the browser HTML and ECMAScript
        ecosystem, using a script to run HTTP requests from the
        authenticator to the relying party with a token in Authorization
        request header.  In the latter case, the server exchanges the
        token for a cookie, and a script on the authenticator page then
        effects a redirect by changing the window location.
      </t>

      <t>
        Such redirect-based protocols do not work for non-browser
        user-agents.
      </t>

      <t>
        User-agents normally do not copy response headers from redirect
        responses redirected requests.  One common non-browser
        user-agent, the <eref target="&InvokeWebRequest;">PowerShell
          command-line user-agent</eref>, has an option, <spanx
          style="verb">-PreserveAuthorizationOnRedirect</spanx> that
        causes it to copy Authorization headers from redirect responses
        to redirected requests.  This enables some redirect-based
        workflows to work even though that user-agent is not a browser,
        lacks interaction capabilities, HTML rendering, or JavaScript
        support.
      </t>

      <t>
        Here we define the "Redirect" HTTP authentication scheme.  This
        scheme lets arbitrary authentication (and authorization)
        protocols exchange cryptographic messages between the relying
        party origin and the authenticator origin over headers rather
        than URI parameters.  This is done by preserving a new header,
        "Authorization-Request" across redirects, and the existing
        "Authorization" header across redirects back to previous origins
        in the redirect chain.
      </t>

      <t>
        For our purposes, a "redirect response" is either a 3xx redirect
        response with a Location header, or a 401 response with a
        WWW-Authenticate header naming the Redirect authentication
        scheme and a Location header.
      </t>

      <t>
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>
            User-agents that support the Redirect HTTP authentication
            scheme MUST recognize a 401 Redirect challenge as a redirect
            response.

                  One possibility is to let the redirecting origin specify

          <t>
            User-agents SHOULD also consider challenges for other
            authentication schemes offered by the server.  E.g., if the
            server offers a Negotiate <xref target="RFC4559"/> challenge
            and a Redirect challenge, the user-agent may choose either
            (or neither) of the two.
          </t>

          <t>
            User-agents that support the Redirect HTTP authentication
            scheme MUST copy any Authorization-Request headers in redirect
            responses to the redirected request.
          </t>

          <t>
            User-agents that support the Redirect HTTP authentication
            scheme MUST copy any Authorization headers in redirect
            responses to the redirected request when the redirect is to
            an origin seen earlier in the same redirect chain.

          <t>
            Servers needing to authenticate the user when the user-agent
            has advertised support for the Redirect authentication scheme
            SHOULD respond with a 401 with a "challenge" for the Redirect
            authentication scheme and a Location header, and MAY include
            an Authorization-Request header in the response that the
            user-agent then MUST copy to the redirected request if it
            chooses to follow the redirection.
          </t>

          <t>
            Servers that have been redirected to MUST apply local policy

      <t>
        Making use of the new Accept-Auth, Accept-Redirect, and
        Accept-Redirect-Auth request headers will often require no
        changes to existing HTTP user-agents and servers.  This is
        because the application usually gets to set and inspect
        arbitrary headers.  On the server side it may be difficult for
        an application to add support for the Redirect authentication
        scheme without modifying the HTTP server.  Therefore it may be
        difficult for an application to issue a 401 Redirect, and it may
        have to use a 3xx redirect instead.
      </t>

      <t>
        Therefore, user-agents MUST treat 3xx and 401 Redirect responses
        similarly, applying the same local policy in either case.
      </t>

      <section anchor="redirect_plus_auth" title="3xx Responses with WWW-Authenticate">
        <t>
          If a server responds with a 3xx and includes not only a Location
          header but also a WWW-Authenticate header, then the redirect
          denotes intent to authenticate the user.  In this case, the
          user-agent SHALL consider the response to be either a redirect or
          a request to authenticate, at the user-agent's choice.  The HTTP
          method to use at the new Location SHALL be as specified for the
          status code used by the server.
        </t>

        <t>
          Note that many user-agents will not understand that such

        <t>
          If a server responds with a 401 and includes not just a

          user either via the server's authentication scheme offerings, or
          redirection.  In this case, a user-agent conforming to this
          specification SHALL consider the response to be either a redirect
          or a request to authenticate, at the user-agent's choice, and
          SHOULD pick and execute one of those two options.  The user-agent
          SHOULD use the GET method at the new Location, with the expectation
          of eventually being redirected back to the original URI authority,
          at which point the user-agent, if it chooses to retry the
          original request, SHOULD use the original method.

        advice.  When a server supports multiple authentication schemes and the
        user-agent does include the Accept-Auth header in its request, then the
        server SHOULD select at least one scheme for a 401 response's
        WWW-Authenticate header that the user-agent also supports, but the
        server MAY respond with a 3xx redirect response if the
        user-agent indicated support for redirects via the
        Accept-Redirect header or by advertising support for the
        Redirect HTTP authentication scheme.

    <section title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>
        IANA is requested to assign an expert to run the Expert Review
        for the registration of the Accept-Auth, Accept-Redirect,
        Accept-Redirect-Auth, and Authorization-Request headers in the
        message header registry.
      </t>
      <t>
        Upon completion of IETF Review, IANA is directed to add the
        Redirect authentication scheme to the HTTP Authentication Scheme
        registry.
      </t>

      <t>
        There is no registry for auth-params for HTTP authentication
        schemes, nor do we request the creation of such a registry.  The
        auth-params used here bear some relation to those of the
        authentication schemes they are used with, but they are essentially
        a distinct namespace.  Future additions of auth-params for use in
        the Accept-Auth header will have to update this document.
      </t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>
        The Accept-Auth header is security-relevant as it helps negotiate
        authentication, which is a positive consideration.  Negative
        security considerations include multi-level negotiation issues
        <xref target="multi_level_nego"/>, as well as a privacy concern:
        that the Accept-Auth header may help fingerprint user-agents.
      </t>

      <t>
        Privacy-conscious user-agents MAY have local policy about which
        authorities to use the new Accept-Auth, Accept-Redirect, and
        Accept-Redirect-Auth headers.
      </t>

      <t>
        Also, the Authorization-Request and Authorization header
        preservation behavior allows attackers to convey malformed
        tokens to victim servers, allowing them to probe for parsing
        bugs.  However, this is essentially already true for the URI
        itself, therefore this is not a new issue.  Note that
        Authorization headers are not to be preserved in all redirects,
        just those that backtrack in the redirect chain.  That means
        that there can be no confusion as to whether a given
        Authorization header was added by the user-agent or a
        redirecting origin: it will be either, but never both, and the
        relying party origins don't care which it is.
      </t>

      <t>
        One concern is that servers could cause user-agents to engage in
        authentication schemes they shouldn't want to -- that is a
        possibility regardless of whether the user-agent advertises
        support for an authentication scheme or not.  As usual, local
        policy is relevant.  For example, the "curl" user-agent by
        default will not chase redirections, and if enabled, it will by
        default not authenticate at any redirected authority (this can
        be further enabled).  User-agents SHOULD have local policy about
        which redirections they will accept, whether to authenticate to
        redirected authorities, and with what methods.  For example, a
        user-agent may be willing to use the Negotiate authentication
        scheme at some or any redirected authorities if it is happy to
        let Kerberos implementations, including Key Distribution Centers
        (KDCs), apply policy on the user-agent's behalf, but may not be
        willing to perform Basic, Digest, or SCRAM authentication to any
        redirected authorities not on a local whitelist.
      </t>

      <section anchor="multi_level_nego" title="Multi-Level Negotiation">
        <t>
          One important security consideration of the Accept-Auth header is that
          it may lead to multiple levels of negotiation (e.g., via the Negotiate
          <xref target="RFC4559"/> authentication method).  Multi-level
          negotiations can fail to select to select a workable option, or may
          select a sub-optimal (e.g., less secure) option.
        </t>

        <t>
          For example, a user-agent might be able to use Digest
          authentication and Negotiate with some GSS-API <xref
          target="RFC2743"/> mechanism X, while the server might be able to
          use Digest and Negotiate with some GSS-API mechanism Y, and the
          server might prefer Y.  If the server knows only that the
          user-agent supports Digest and Negotiate, but not that the
          user-agent does not support GSS-API mechanism Y, then the server
          may send a challenge to use Negotiate and then the whole
          negotiation will fail.
        </t>

        <t>
          In the above example the user-agent could recover by retrying
          without advertising Negotiate in its Accept-Auth header, but the
          user-agent is not likely to do this on account of that being too
          complex.  Neither the user-agent nor the server are likely to
          detect and recover from sub-optimal selections.
        </t>

        <t>
          To avoid this failure more, user-agents SHOULD use auth-params to
          convey information that the server might need to make an
          appropriate.
